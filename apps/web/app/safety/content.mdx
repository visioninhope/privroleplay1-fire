# Safety

At OpenRoleplay.ai, we recognize the power of AI and are committed to using it responsibly. We have clear rules to protect children, respect people's privacy, and prevent harmful or illegal content.

Our goal is to let people be creative and use AI in new ways, but we must also keep vulnerable groups safe. It's against our rules to make photorealistic images of children or show extreme or illegal things. We also don't allow people to use our AI to make content that is violent, hateful, or disrespectful.

We use AI and our community to keep our platform safe and welcoming. You can help by reporting any inappropriate content, tagging content correctly, and giving feedback. Your help is very important in building a safe AI community.

Together, we can use AI to create something new and exciting while respecting each other and our boundaries.

  # Content Rules: Minors

We're committed to creating a safe, inclusive, and respectful environment for everyone. We are dedicated to harnessing the potential of AI responsibly, prioritizing the safety and wellbeing of minors. In line with this, we've refined our guidelines for content depicting minors.

## Depicting Minors

Portraying minors in any inappropriate or suggestive context is strictly prohibited. This includes:

1. **Clothing:** All attire should be age-appropriate and conservative. The benchmark is elementary, middle, and high school dress codes. Ask, "Would this outfit be suitable for a school day?" If not, refrain from using it.
2. **Photorealism:** Photorealistic images that could be mistaken for a real minor are strictly prohibited.
3. **Poses:** Poses should be natural, innocent, and age-appropriate. Avoid any poses and facial expressions that could be misinterpreted as suggestive or inappropriate.
4. **Interactions:** Interactions between minors and adults, or between minors themselves, should be appropriate, non-suggestive, and common in a wholesome, everyday context.

## FAQs

### Q: How are these guidelines enforced?

**A:** Every uploaded image undergoes AI content and moderation tagging (utilizing OpenAI's API) to automatically flag potentially inappropriate content. If a model is marked as representing a minor and the image contains either inappropriate content or is photorealistic, it's reviewed by a human moderator before being allowed on the site. Our AI detection isn't perfect, so if you spot something, please report it.

### Q: How can I report content that I believe violates the community guidelines?

**A:** If you find content that doesn't adhere to our guidelines, especially concerning minors, don't hesitate to report it. A "Report" button is available on most images and models throughout the site. If you can't find it, you can reach out to our moderators on our Discord server. Your vigilance helps us maintain a safe and respectful community.

### Q: Why are you so strict about this?

**A:** Great question! We have two key reasons:

1. **Ethical:** Child exploitation is universally unacceptable. Our guidelines are designed to protect and respect the dignity of all individuals, especially minors.
2. **Legal:** Being a US-based entity, we're obliged to follow laws governing content involving minors.

### Q: I've used terms that invoke youth in my prompt, but the image doesn't resemble that. Is that okay?

**A:** Be cautious with terms related to minors. Avoid terms that suggest the likeness of minors with mature or suggestive themes, or with the intent to create photorealism, even if the resulting image doesn't resemble a minor.

### Q: How do you determine if a character is a minor or not?

**A:** Our evaluation is based on both the specific image and its context. For example, characters in a school setting are usually assumed to be school-aged. We avoid setting strict definitions to prevent users from pushing the boundaries. Our priority is a safe and respectful environment for all.

### Q: My resource is meant to depict a fictional character who is a minor. Can I depict them in a manner that is not age-appropriate?

**A:** No, we apply the same standards to fictional characters who are minors as we do to real-life minors. They should be depicted in an age-appropriate manner.

### Q: Are there any restrictions on using AI to create child-like models?

**A:** Yes, creating photorealistic models of minors is strictly prohibited.

### Q: What happens if someone repeatedly violates the community guidelines?

**A:** We take guideline violations seriously. We have a 0 strike policy for violations involving minors. Offending content will be removed, and the uploader will be banned from the platform.

### Q: I'm not sure if my content adheres to the guidelines. What should I do?

**A:** When in doubt, err on the side of caution. Contact us in Discord with questions or concerns before posting your content. We're here to assist!

### Q: Can I provide feedback or suggest changes to the community guidelines?

**A:** Absolutely! Your input is valuable to us. If you have suggestions for improving the guidelines or notice something we missed, let us know by submitting feedback or reaching out to us on Discord.

Remember, these guidelines are here to ensure our community remains a safe, respectful, and constructive space for all. With your cooperation and input, we can make this community a shining example of responsible and creative use of AI.

  # Content Rules: Real People

We're committed to keeping it an enjoyable and respectful space for everyone. A place where we can harness the power of AI, while ensuring everyone's privacy and consent are respected. To this end, we've been refining our guidelines regarding the use of images depicting real people.

## Depicting Real People

Portraying real people in any mature or suggestive context is strictly prohibited. This includes:

1. **Clothing:** No low-cut shirts/dresses, short skirts or anything that wouldn't pass a conservative high school dress code. Think, "Would I wear this to a professional job interview?" If not, it's best to refrain.
2. **Body Parts:** Exaggerated depictions of breasts, butts, thighs, or genitalia are a no-go zone. We're all about capturing likeness, not exaggeration or objectification.
3. **Poses:** Let's keep it professional, folks! Avoid suggestive poses like looking over the shoulder, bending over, or any poses meant to accentuate body features. The same goes for facial expressions meant to infer arousal.

## FAQs

### Q: How are these guidelines enforced?

**A:** Every image generated is sent for AI content and moderation tagging (utilizing OpenAI's API), which automatically flags images potentially containing mature content. For models that have been marked as representing a real person, any image that potentially contains mature content is sent for manual human moderator review before the image will be allowed to appear on the site. Our AI detection isn't perfect, and not all images containing real people are properly tagged, so if you see something, please take a moment to report it.

### Q: How can I report content that I believe violates the community guidelines?

**A:** If you come across content that you believe doesn't adhere to our community guidelines, please don't hesitate to report it. A "Report" button is generally available in content menus on most images and models through-out the site. If you don't see it, you can always reach out to the moderators on our Discord server. We appreciate your vigilance in keeping our community safe and respectful.

### Q: Why are you so strict about this?

**A:** Good question! We believe that everyone has the right to their own likeness. Unless people have explicitly given consent to be depicted in a certain way, we don't condone it. We're all about fostering a respectful community, and we want to lay down clear expectations now, to protect all our users in the future.

### Q: I've used a person's name in my prompt, but the image doesn't resemble them. Is that okay?

**A:** Absolutely. As long as the intent wasn't to depict _that_ person in a way that goes against our guidelines, you're good to go.

### Q: What if my resource is of an adult-film star, who regularly appears in more revealing clothing?

**A:** Great point, but here's the distinction. Those individuals consented to being filmed and depicted in certain ways. Here on Openroleplay.ai, we want to ensure we respect everyone's consent, regardless of their profession.

### Q: My resource is meant to depict a character, like Jack Reacher, but it's trained on Tom Cruise and Alan Ritchson. So can I not do NSFW content of the character?

**A:** The key here is resemblance. If the image closely resembles either actor, it's best to keep it SFW. Let's focus on capturing the essence of the character, rather than anything more provocative.

### Q: Can I use historical figures in my AI models?

**A:** Yes, but with respect and dignity. Historical figures can be a great resource for educational purposes. However, it's important to depict them accurately and respectfully, to honor the history they represent.

### Q: What about using images of fictional characters played by real actors?

**A:** Fictional characters are generally fair game, but remember, if likeness is very obvious (Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt from Mission Impossible for example), it's important to adhere to the same guidelines we use for real people.

### Q: I am the real person or a legal representitive of the real person displayed in these images. I did not consent to the use of my likeness, can they be taken down?

**A:** We care a lot about the rights of individuals and the use of their likeness. If you find an image thats depicting your likeness you can request to have removed by emailing us at help@openroleplay.ai.

### Q: Are there any restrictions on using AI to create child-like models?

**A:** Models intended for the photo-realistic depiction of minors are prohibited. You can read more about our requirements for content depicting minors.

### Q: What happens if someone repeatedly violates the community guidelines?

**A:** We take violations of our community guidelines seriously. Users who repeatedly fail to comply with our guidelines may face sanctions, such as content removal, temporary suspension, or, in extreme cases, permanent banishment from the kingdom (community). We hope it never comes to that, though!

### Q: Can I provide feedback or suggest changes to the community guidelines?

**A:** Of course! We value your input. After all, this community is like a potluck – everyone brings something to the table. If you have suggestions for improving the guidelines or have spotted something we might have missed, please let us know by reaching out to us on Discord.

Remember, these guidelines are here to make sure that Openroleplay.ai remains an innovative, respectful, and constructive community. With your cooperation and input, we can continue to make this community a shining example of how AI can be harnessed responsibly and creatively.
