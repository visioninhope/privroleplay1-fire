        Openroleplay.ai - Crystal Terms and Conditions
      </h1>
      <p>Last Updated: 12/29/2023</p>
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-4 mb-2">
        PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING CRYSTAL TERMS CAREFULLY:
      </h2>
      <p>
        These Crystal Terms and Conditions (“Crystal Terms”) govern your receipt
        and use of Crystal through the Service and are Additional Terms under
        the Openroleplay.ai Terms of Service (“Terms of Service”), which is a
        legally binding contract between you and Openroleplay.ai and
        incorporated into these Crystal Terms by this reference. Capitalized
        terms used but not defined in these Crystal Terms will have the meanings
        set forth elsewhere in the Terms of Service.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-4 mb-2">What is Crystal?</h2>
      <p>
        “Crystal” is the official virtual credits of the Services. Users may
        acquire Crystal by (i) purchasing or otherwise receiving Crystal from
        Openroleplay.ai; (ii) receiving tips and transfers from other Users on
        the Service, and (iii) earning Crystal as reward from a contest, bounty,
        or other eligible activities with respect to the Service. Crystal may be
        used on the Service in several ways: (i) tipping creators to show
        appreciation for their work; (ii) posting bounties and offering Crystal
        as a reward; (iii) using Crystal to train models with the
        Openroleplay.ai’s Trainer; (iv) accessing advanced plugins for AI
        models; and (v) by other means that Openroleplay.ai may introduce.
        Crystal is not a substitute for fiat currency, Crystal does not earn
        interest, and has no equivalent value in fiat currency. Except as
        otherwise outlined in these Crystal Terms, Crystal cannot be redeemed
        for any fiat currency, and Openroleplay.ai is not obligated to exchange
        a User’s Crystal for anything else of value.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-4 mb-2">License to Crystal.</h2>
      <p>
        Your acquisition or purchase of Crystal only entitles you to receive a
        limited, non-transferable, revocable license to use Crystal (i) in
        connection with the Services, (ii) for your personal entertainment only,
        and (iii) in the ways permitted under the Terms of Service. Your limited
        license to use Crystal may end if (i) you violate the Terms of Service;
        (ii) your Account is suspended or terminated; or (iii) with 30 days’
        notice if these Crystal Terms or the Services is terminated, without
        payment, or liability to you. Except for the limited licenses granted to
        you under the Crystal Terms, Openroleplay.ai retains all rights in and
        to Crystal. Openroleplay.ai makes no guarantees or warranties regarding
        Crystal or their availability or value.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-4 mb-2">Promotional Offers.</h2>
      <p>
        Openroleplay.ai reserves the right to determine pricing for Crystal and
        may, at its sole discretion, make promotional offers with different
        features and different pricing to any Users. These promotional offers,
        unless made to you, will not apply to your purchase or use of Crystal.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-4 mb-2">Prohibited Conduct.</h2>
      <p>
        You may not use, acquire, or distribute Crystal except through the
        Services and except as expressly allowed by Openroleplay.ai. Any attempt
        to do so constitutes a violation of the Terms of Service, will render
        the transaction void, and may result in the immediate suspension or
        termination of your Account and your license to use Crystal or the
        Service. Openroleplay.ai does not recognize or take responsibility for
        third-party services that allow Users to sell, transfer, purchase, or
        otherwise use Crystal, and any such use by a User is a violation of the
        Terms of Service. Only Users who have reached the age of majority in
        their jurisdiction or state of residence may purchase Crystal or engage
        in other real-money transactions on the Services. Except as required by
        law, all payments for Crystal are final and not refundable.
        Openroleplay.ai may implement changes to Crystal and these Crystal Terms
        at any time at Openroleplay.ai’s sole discretion; this may include
        limiting the number of Crystal a User may acquire or lowering the
        purchase price of Crystal.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-4 mb-2">Crystal Dashboard.</h2>
      <p>
        You can access and track your Crystal using the Crystal Dashboard page
        from either the Crystal dashboard link on the main menu, or by clicking
        your Crystal balance in the top left of the menu header. The My Crystal
        Dashboard page shows Recent Transactions, your Lifetime Crystal amount,
        and will list ways to earn (and use) your Crystal. Crystal may, in
        Openroleplay.ai’s sole discretion be exchanged for fiat (“Cash Out”).
        Such Cash Out may require a minimum Crystal amount for conversion to
        fiat currency. Openroleplay.ai reserves the right to determine the
        currency in which Crystal is exchanged. You are responsible for all
        transaction fees in connection with Cash Out transactions, if any, and
        these fees will vary depending on the payment method you choose.
        Furthermore, Openroleplay.ai, in its sole discretion, will determine
        whether you are eligible to Cash Out by reviewing information on your
        Account, requirements under applicable law, and your compliance with the
        Terms of Service and these Crystal Terms.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-4 mb-2">Eligibility to Cash Out.</h2>
      <p>
        Openroleplay.ai may, at its discretion, place restrictions on your
        ability to Cash Out, reject any request you make to Cash Out, and
        determine how much you are eligible to Cash Out. For example,
        Openroleplay.ai generally limits a User’s ability to Cash Out $1,000 or
        more per day and may deny your request to Cash Out more than that
        amount. Any User requesting to Cash Out $1,000 or more worth of Crystal
        in any given day will need to provide information to Openroleplay.ai in
        order for Openroleplay.ai to conduct certain checks and verifications on
        the User. This information may include, at Openroleplay.ai’s discretion,
        your bank name and account, the address of your primary residence, your
        full legal name, a government-issued identification number, tax
        information (an IRS form W-9 for U.S. taxpayers and an IRS form W-8 for
        non-U.S. taxpayers), and copies or images of related documents
        (“Verification Documentation”). Openroleplay.ai reserves the right to
        decline or cancel any Cash Out for any reason, including in the event
        that the Verification Documentation appears to be inaccurate, cannot be
        verified, does not uniquely identify you, or that a Cash Out request
        would be, as determined by Openroleplay.ai at its discretion,
        inappropriate. For example, Openroleplay.ai may deny Cash Out requests
        that involve suspected money laundering or suspicious or fraudulent
        account activity or payments of $1,000 or more in any given day. Certain
        age restrictions may also apply to the availability of Cash Out
        opportunities, depending on local laws and the policies of
        Openroleplay.ai’s third-party vendors. Even if you request to Cash Out,
        you will only receive Openroleplay.ai’s selected currency in exchange
        for Crystal held in your Account if Openroleplay.ai determines, at its
        discretion, that you are eligible to Cash Out. Openroleplay.ai also
        reserves the right to deny Cash Out payments to any User that
        Openroleplay.ai determines, at its discretion, has violated these
        Crystal Terms or the Terms of Service in any way.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-4 mb-2">
        Expiration and Modification of Crystal.
      </h2>
      <p>
        Notwithstanding any provision of these Crystal Terms to the contrary, if
        your Account is deleted by you, Openroleplay.ai may close your Account
        and delete any Crystal balance. If Openroleplay.ai terminates your
        Account for inactivity or otherwise, your license to all Crystal
        associated with your Account will terminate immediately and all Crystal
        associated with your Account will expire, without compensation of any
        kind to you, subject to any limitations or obligations under applicable
        law. Openroleplay.ai reserves the right to modify, amend, or cancel
        these Crystal Terms, add, remove, or modify the eligibility
        requirements, and change the exchange rate for a Cash Out, in each case,
        at any time and for any reason. The existence of the Crystal Terms in no
        way creates an obligation for us to continue making Cash Outs available
        in the future, nor does it guarantee that a Cash Out payment can be made
        in the future, subject to applicable law. Openroleplay.ai reserves the
        right to review activity on any Account to assess the validity of your
        eligibility to Cash Out.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-4 mb-2">DISCLAIMERS.</h2>
      <p>
        NOTWITHSTANDING ANY DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES IN THE TERMS OF SERVICE,
        TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, OPENROLEPLAY.AI MAY, IN ITS SOLE
        DISCRETION, AMEND, MODIFY, OR TERMINATE YOUR RIGHT TO CRYSTAL, INCLUDING
        TERMINATING YOUR ABILITY TO USE OR REDEEM CRYSTAL ALREADY ACCRUED, AT
        ANY TIME. THE ACCUMULATION OF ANY CRYSTAL IN YOUR ACCOUNT DOES NOT
        ENTITLE YOU TO ANY VESTED RIGHT WITH RESPECT TO ANY SPECIFIC AWARD OR
        BENEFIT. IN ACCUMULATING CRYSTAL, YOU MAY NOT RELY UPON THE CONTINUED
        AVAILABILITY OF ANY CRYSTAL OR RELATED BENEFIT, AND YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE
        TO OBTAIN BENEFITS FOR ALL OR ANY CRYSTAL.
