# 🔓 Visibility

The Visibility setting determines who can see and interact your AI character.

- **Public:** Choose this option if you want your character to be visible and interactive for everyone. It will be available for all users to discover and enjoy. **Each time other users interact with your character, you can earn crystals to spend on your public character.**
- **Private:** Choose this if you want to keep your character just to yourself. Only you can see or interact with it. It's like having a secret friend that only you know about.

  Please be aware that even if your characters are set to hidden and not visible
  to everyone, our content moderation system provided by OpenAI and our cloud
  provider might still check your character automatically. If a character breaks
  our community rules, it can be removed or hidden, **no matter if it's hidden
  or public.** We suggest you get to know our community guidelines well to help
  keep our platform safe and enjoyable for everyone.
