# üè∑Ô∏è Name

The name is crucial for your AI character's identity and is used to identify them in conversations. If you decide to share your character, this name is what others will see.

- **Style:** You have options like a single name ("Aurora"), a full name ("Jane Doe"), or a creative / descriptive nickname ("AI Magician").
- **Impact:** The name you choose can shape your character's personality, particularly if it's named after a well-known figure. For instance, a character named "Alan Turing" might adopt characteristics that are commonly associated with that name.
- **Uniqueness:** character names can be duplicated, so there might be others with the same name. But, by pairing the character's name with your unique username, you can make sure your character stands out.

Keep in mind that your AI character's name does more than establish its identity; it can also influence its personality and how it interacts. Opt for a name that reflects the character's intended function, character traits, and narrative.
