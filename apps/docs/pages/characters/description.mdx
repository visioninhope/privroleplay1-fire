# ðŸ“™ Description

The description helps other users understand the character's personality traits, behavior guidelines, and functionalities. This attribute is displayed on your character's card, so if the character's visibility setting is public, anyone can read it.

When instructions are not provided, characters will consider their description as their instruction, thereby prioritizing these instructions over regular conversations and allowing you to effectively control their responses.

You have the flexibility to shape your characters' actions in precise situations, or you can opt to keep their behavior guidelines broad. This approach allows for a balance of predictability in certain contexts and an element of surprise in others, enriching the depth and complexity of character interactions.

- **Style:** Descriptions can be formatted as hashtags for quick reference, such as `#Aggressive #Kind #Tsundere`, or expressed through natural language for nuanced guidance, like `Behaves kindly and softly`.
- **Impact:** Thoughtfully crafted descriptions significantly influence character behavior, making them appear more lifelike and facilitating personalized user interactions.
