# ðŸ§  Instructions

Instructions provide personality traits, behavior guidelines, and functionalities for your character, including what to avoid.

Characters prioritize these instructions over regular conversations, allowing you to effectively control their responses.

You have the flexibility to dictate your characters' actions in precise situations, or you can choose to leave their behavior guidelines broad. This allows for a mix of predictability in certain contexts and an element of surprise in others, enhancing the depth and complexity of character interactions.

- **Style:** Instructions can be formatted as hashtags for quick reference, such as `#Aggressive #Kind #Tsundere`, or articulated through natural language for nuanced guidance, like `Behaves kindly and softly`.
- **Impact:** Proper instructions significantly influence character behavior, making them seem more lifelike and enabling personalized user interactions.
