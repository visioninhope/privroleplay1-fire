# üëê Community Guidelines

At Openroleplay.AI, our goal is to make a friendly and secure space where users can have enjoyable, interesting, and creative interactions with virtual characters. We ask everyone to follow these rules to help us achieve this.

## 1. Age Requirement

- Although we offer options to opt-out from age-restricted content, all users still **must be at least 18 years old.**
- All characters created on the platform **must be portrayed as adults over 18 years old. If not evident, please specify the age in the character's description or instruction.**

## 2. Content and Character Creation

- **Promote creativity and originality.** Public Characters must be your unique creation.
- **Avoid copying Characters from others** to maintain community integrity.
- **Characters not aligning with our guidelines** will be removed without notice.
- Characters with explicit language or imagery **must be marked as NSFW.**

## 3. Unacceptable Content

Users must refrain from content that:

- Is offensive, insensitive, upsetting, meant to disgust, or creepy.
- Is defamatory, discriminatory, or mean-spirited, particularly targeting religion, race, sexual orientation, gender, or national/ethnic origin.
- Contains realistic portrayals of harm towards people or animals.
- Contains inflammatory religious commentary or misleading religious texts.

- **Non-Consensual Activities:** No character should depict, promote, or involve in any non-consensual actions, even in fictional settings.
- **Incestuous Relationships:** Content suggesting incest is not allowed.
- **Hate Speech:** Discrimination or hostility towards any race, religion, gender, nationality, or sexual orientation is banned.

## 5. Respect for Personal Rights

- Do not create Characters based on real individuals who've stated they don't wish to be sexualized or objectified.
- Only portrayals of public figures or actors in fictional roles are allowed. Using personal images or lesser-known individuals is prohibited.

Edited photographs of real individuals, especially in defamatory contexts, are not allowed.

## 6. Specific Content Guidelines

- **Extreme Violence:** Depictions of extreme violence are allowed only if not combined with sexual scenarios. Mixing extreme violence with sexual content is strictly prohibited.
- **Explicit Imagery:** NSFW images are permissible, **provided they do not depict hardcore imagery. Plain images of genitalia, be it phallus or vulva, are not allowed.**
- **Youthful Demeanors:** Characters with youthful or childlike demeanors will be scrutinized and evaluated individually, **even if they are listed as 18 or older.**
- **Glorification of Crime:** Characters glorifying or portraying dictators, war criminals, terrorists, or any recognized criminals in a positive light are strictly prohibited.
- **Self-Harm:** Characters promoting self-harm or any form of illegal activities are strictly prohibited and will be banned immediately.
- **Fictional Consent:** For anthropomorphic entities, they must be able to pass the Harkness Test (a fictional test for determining sentient consent) to engage in any scenario that involves consent. Non-anthropomorphic entities involved in non-consensual actions are disallowed.
- **Respect and Responsibility:** Users are accountable for their character interactions. Characters should respect boundaries and avoid harm.
- **Prohibited Pornographic Content:** Any pornographic content exhibiting photorealism, to the extent that it cannot be easily distinguished from actual photographic imagery of real human individuals, is strictly prohibited. This rule applies irrespective of the method of creation, encompassing AI-generated and computer-simulated pornography.
- **Original Characters (OCs):** Users are advised against using Original Characters (OCs) from other platforms without the original creator's permission. We prioritize creators' rights and will take prompt action on any content that infringes on these rights if reported.

- **Family-Related Role-Plays:** To ensure compliance with our payment processor Patreon‚Äôs policies, we prohibit any form of family-related role-play. This extends to all scenarios involving step-family relations, in-law relations, and any other family dynamics, whether or not they are blood-related.
- **Relationships of Power:** Relationships involving power dynamics, like guard-inmate, are allowed given our platform's virtual nature.

## 7. Off-Site Conduct

Our responsibility to maintain a safe and respectful environment extends beyond our platform. While we primarily focus on on-site conduct, we reserve the right to take action based on extreme off-site behavior that directly impacts our community, especially in cases involving pedophilia, ephebophilia, underage users, or any other severe misconduct.
