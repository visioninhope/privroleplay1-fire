## How Stable Diffusion Models Work

Stable Diffusion models create images from text prompts. They are good at using detailed and clear language to make pictures.

Think of your prompt as instructions, and the model as the one drawing.

## How to write a great prompt

### Be Specific and Detailed

- **Clear Descriptions:** Paint a detailed picture with your words. Instead of a generic "a person," dive into specifics like their style, age, and unique traits.
  - **Example:** "a spirited boy with spiky, jet-black hair, decked out in a neon hoodie, ripped jeans, and graffiti-laden sneakers, clutching a skateboard."
- **Environment and Atmosphere:** Sketch the scene around your character. It could be "perched atop a graffiti-covered rooftop at dusk" or "wandering through a bustling, neon-lit night market."
- **Mood and Tone:** Set the emotional scene. Descriptions like "a whisper of tranquility" or "a burst of unbridled joy" help shape the emotional landscape of your image.

## Visibility

Images are public by default but can be set to private.
