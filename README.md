## License

ThetaSpaces1 is open-source under the GNU Affero General Public License Version 3 (AGPLv3). You can find it [here](/LICENSE). The goal of the AGPLv3 license is to:

- Maximize user freedom and to encourage users to contribute to open source.
- Prevent corporations from taking the code and using it as part of their closed-source proprietary products
- Prevent corporations from offering ThetaSpaces1 as a service without contributing to the open source project
- Prevent corporations from confusing people and making them think that the service they sell is in any shape or form approved by the original team
